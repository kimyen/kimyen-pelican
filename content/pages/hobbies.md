Summary: things I do for dopamine

My passion in life is learning as much as I can about everything. When I get older, I realized that I don't enjoy learning everything all the time. My focus comes in phases, with a goal as my motivation.

As an adult, the first hobby that I have was card making. I watched people made cards on YouTube and it helped me fall asleep in college. When I graduated and worked, I started to earn money and was able to buy the tools and materials I saw the YouTuber used. I spent 5 years acquiring tools, making tons of cards and other paper crafting projects. For years, I was able to see a handmade card and know how to make it, and have the materials to make it. I had my cards on Etsy, and was selling them. I started to get bored.

Since, I acquires other hobbies like gardening, knitting, laser cutting, and leather work. I am gretful for having a job that allows me to invest in myself, and to consume the knowledge of the world, one hobby at a time. (The last piece here may not be true. :) Maybe it's my passion in life, or I told myself so. Or it's simply the dopamine that I am after.
