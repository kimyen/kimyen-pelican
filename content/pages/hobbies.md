Summary: things I do for dopamine

I grew up in a family where my parents changes jobs all the time. They would pick up anything that they can make money to feed us. They takes work home and my siblings and I helped out. This exposed me to so many different crafts and the happiness dopamine creates.

I am grateful for having a job that allows me to continue generating dopamine after work hours. I picked up many different hobbies that helps me busy, healthy and happy.

Some crafts that I've done:
- card making and paper crafting
- gardenning; succulents and house plan collecting
- knitting
- laser cutting
- leather work
